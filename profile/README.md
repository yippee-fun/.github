# Yippee

We’re building a set of libraries to support our vision for a new full stack web framework. At the same time, we want each tool to stand on its own and integrate with Rails where appropriate.

### Stable Projects

- **[Literal](https://literal.fun)** provides runtime type checking in Ruby with a bunch of useful types and data structures.
- **[Phlex](https://www.phlex.fun)** lets you write object-oriented HTML, SVG and CSV views in Ruby.
- **[Good Cop](https://github.com/yippee-fun/goodcop)** is a Rubocop configuration that matches our taste — pragmatic and flexible. It’s meant to be used vis Ruby LSP with auto-corrections enabled on save.
- **[Strict Ivars](https://github.com/yippee-fun/strict_ivars)** makes Ruby raise a `NameError` if you read an undefined instance variable.

### Works in Progress

- **[Plume](https://github.com/yippee-fun/plume)** is a SQLite-dialect SQL parser written in Ruby.
- **[Quickdraw](https://github.com/yippee-fun/quickdraw)** is a multi-core test runner.

### Planned

- A secret frontend project
- A routing-tree based router (similar to Roda)
- An ORM for SQLite
